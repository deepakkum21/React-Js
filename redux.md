## Redux vs UseContext

| Feature            | `useContext`                       | `Redux`                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**           | React built-in hook                | External state management library                    |
| **Best for**       | Small, simple global state         | Large, complex, or shared global state               |
| **Boilerplate**    | Very little                        | More setup and boilerplate                           |
| **DevTools**       | ❌ None built-in                   | ✅ Excellent DevTools support                        |
| **Middleware**     | ❌ Not supported directly          | ✅ Supports middleware (e.g. logging, async)         |
| **Performance**    | Re-renders all consumers on change | Fine-grained control with `connect()`                |
| **Async Logic**    | Manual via effects or custom hooks | Handled with Redux middleware like `thunk` or `saga` |
| **Learning Curve** | Very easy                          | Moderate to steep                                    |
